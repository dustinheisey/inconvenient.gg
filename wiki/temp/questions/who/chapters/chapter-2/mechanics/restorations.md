# Restorations

The whole point of this modpack is to restore a earth damaged from climate change. Pre dream you do this by opening gateways, after the dream if you choose to wake up you do this by cleaning up and restoring the environments. After getting particular achievements you unlock game stages that let new animals spawn naturally in the overworld.

you go to dimensions that unlocks the dimension page instructing you about the dimension and how to open the gateway. you open the gateway that unlocks the final part of that dimension page that shows what animals spawn now. at the end of stage 4, once you find oil or something some decorative animals stop spawning and you get notified in one of the journal entries. after choosing to wake up at the end of chapter 6 you get the manifest and do tasks. upon completing tasks new animals will spawn and be added to the entries for whatever related biome. if you choose to stay asleep then you get a new entry that shows all the zombie versions of animals that are replaced, you get a new checklist that is about making money.
